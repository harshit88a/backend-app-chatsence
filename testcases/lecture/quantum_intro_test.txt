Topic: Intro to Quantum Mechanics

Wave-particle duality?? 
The core idea. Light is both. 

De Broglie wavelength formula... something about momentum. 

Schrodinger's Cat thought experiment - cat is both alive and dead until observed. 
The observer effect is key ****. 

Quantum superposition and entanglement. E
ntanglement is "spooky action at a distance" - Einstein quote. 
Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle - can't know position AND momentum at same time. ** Very important for exam. 

Tunnelling effect - particles can go through barriers they shouldn't be able to. 
Applications: quantum computing, transistors. 

Need to re-read chapter 4 on wave functions. 
What is a qubit ??
