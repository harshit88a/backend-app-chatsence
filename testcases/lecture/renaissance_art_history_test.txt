Topic: Renaissance Art History

- Shift from medieval (flat, religious) to Renaissance (realism, humanism). 
- Centered in Florence, Italy. Patrons like the Medici family ****. 

Key artists: Leonardo da Vinci (Mona Lisa, Last Supper), Michelangelo (David, Sistine Chapel ceiling). 
Techniques: sfumato?? 
(smoky look, da Vinci used it), perspective, chiaroscuro (light/dark contrast) **. 

Brunelleschi's Dome - major architectural feat. 
How did he build it? Notes say new machines. 

Human anatomy became super important, artists studied bodies. 
Shift in subject matter from just religion to mythology and portraits. 
Need to remember the dates for High Renaissance (c. 1490sâ€“1527).
