Topic: DS - Trees

defn?? of tree → non-linear ds??.  

Binary tree - node has ≤2 child. leaf, internal nodes.  
Balanced tree => height log(n), imp ** for search efficiency.  

AVL tree? rotation to keep bal??  

BST - search O(log n) if bal. else O(n).  

Heap vs BST? diff usage. Heap good for priority queue.  

Applications: compiler parsing, DB indexing.  

Prof said **red-black tree** used in real world systems like Linux.  

Exam Q likely: implement insertion in AVL.  

Note: ask TA about diff b/w AVL & RB-tree.  

HW due next week Mon → Q4 is about rotations.
