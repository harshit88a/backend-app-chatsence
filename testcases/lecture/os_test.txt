Topic: OS - Virtual Memory

Concept: prog can be bigger than RAM?? how? VM uses disk.  
Pages + frames → mapping with page table.  
TLB = cache for page table entries. Important** exam.  
Page fault = when page not in mem. OS brings from disk. slow!!  
Thrashing?? occurs when too many pf, sys spends more time swapping than exec.  
Demand paging vs pre-paging?? (not clear).  
Prof stressed working set model (****).  
Ex: 4 frames, 3 progs, see how many page faults (FIFO vs LRU).  
Need to revise Belady’s anomaly??  
Reminder: do practice probs from book chap 8.
