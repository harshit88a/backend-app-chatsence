Topic: Quantum Comp Basics

Qubit defn?? like bit but can be 0 & 1 at same time → superposition.  
Entanglement → linked states, Einstein called spooky action??  
Important** concept in QC algos.  
Grover’s algo for search → sqrt(N) time.  
Shor’s algo → factor numbers fast, risk for encryption.  
Error correction = big challenge. Decoherence = loss of info.  
Reminder: check slides for circuit diagram.  
Hardware: superconducting qubits vs trapped ions.  
Research labs → Google, IBM, IonQ.  
Next seminar: Fri 4pm.  
Note: ask speaker about scalability beyond 100 qubits.
