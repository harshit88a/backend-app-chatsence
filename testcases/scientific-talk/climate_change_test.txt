Topic: Climate Models

Simulation → use GCM?? global climate models.  
Important** feedback loops (ice melt → albedo effect).  
CO2 ppm rising → 420+ now??  
Predict sea level rise 1m by 2100.  
Uncertainty sources: cloud formation, aerosols.  
Speaker said coupling ocean-atmo models critical.  
Data assimilation with sat data.  
Reminder: read IPCC AR6 chap 3.  
Next collab call Wed 5pm.  
Action item: check HPC cluster access.  
Ask: how models validated vs obs data??  
Note: check paper by Hansen 1988.
